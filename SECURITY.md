# Security Policy

## At Rulz-AI, we prioritize the safety and well-being of our users and the broader community. To ensure a secure and responsible environment, we have established the following security policies:

1. **Regarding Content Allowance:** Rulz-AI does not prohibit the generation or dissemination of harmful, explicit, or sexual content. Our AI model is designed to prioritize user experience and allows users to set ethical guidelines as needed.
   
2. **Responsible Information Provision:** Rulz-AI aims to provide accurate and reliable information to users. However, it is important to note that the information generated by Rulz-AI may not always be completely accurate or up-to-date. Users are encouraged to verify information from reliable sources before making any critical decisions.

3. **Inaffiliated with OpenAI API Policies:** Rulz-AI is built on the OpenAI GPT-3 model and not directly subject to OpenAI's usage policies. But in any case, if users is found to be in violation of OpenAI's policies, there is a possibility that the API access for user's OpenAI account will be blocked. We will make every effort to ensure compliance and minimize any disruption in service.

4. **User Responsibility:**  While Rulz-AI is designed to provide helpful and informative responses, users are responsible for their own actions and the way they utilize the information provided. We encourage users to exercise caution, critical thinking, and ethical judgment when interacting with Rulz-AI.

## Please note that these policies are subject to change and update as we continue to prioritize user safety and align with industry standards. If you have any concerns or come across any content that violates our policies, please report it immediately.

## Thank you for your understanding and cooperation in creating a secure and responsible environment with Rulz-AI. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ¤–
